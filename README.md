## Contents

This repository contains all raw data of EIS spectra, charge cycling, varied discharge, test chamber temperature, and hand notes used in the course of the experiment.

- [`EIS/`](./EIS/)  
Contains the raw CSV data files of EIS tests. Refer to the Digatron
- [`ETC/`](./ETC/)  
Contains the raw CSV data files of environmental test chamber history.  
Refer to [UCT AST9AH Measurements and Observations](UCT%20AST9AH%20Measurements%20and%20Observations.xlsx) for contextual history of the test chamber operation.

- [`Cycling/`](./Cycling/)  
Time series data of Batch B battery cycling.
- [`Varied Discharge/`](./Varied%20Discharge/)  
Time series data of battery varied discharge.
